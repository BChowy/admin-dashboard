## Project Overview

Admin Dashboard interface, using "Grid" and "Flexbox".

## Progress

I tried to make the interface as responsive as possible and to look the same through different desktop dimensions as much as possible.

## Learnings

I got to learn how to use "Grid" and "Flexbox" layouts togetherâ€”using "Grid" for two-dimensional and more complex layouts while giving its one-dimensional children the layout of "Flex".

### Additional

I loved how the interface looked before any CSS besides the layouts and with dummy texts, and after it. And I wanted to share it because I think it's cool!
